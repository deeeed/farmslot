 * Whether this run's machine-park record released its slot (ADR-054

 * `slotFreedAt` records the fact, not the intent: it is written only after the
 * park stopped the runner and every manifest resource AND the ownership
 * release landed, so a partial park never reads as freed. While it is set, the
 * park record — not the slot row — is the authority for the run's slot
 * binding: the run keeps `slotId` (the recovery handle and the workspace
 * branch key off it) but stops counting as an occupant of that slot.
 *
 * This is the OCCUPANCY predicate. It must never claim a slot is free before
 * the release actually landed, so dispatch cannot hand out a slot whose worker
 * is still running. Use `isGateParkInFlightOrFreed` for the safety fences,
 * which have the opposite bias.
 *
 * Lives in its own leaf module so slot scoring and fleet refresh can share the
 * one definition without pulling in the gate-held teardown import chain.

 * is restored or cancelled — including the window where the runner and
 * resources are being stopped but `slotFreedAt` has not been written yet.
 *
 * Every guard that must not act on a run whose slot is disappearing uses this:
 * resolving a gate, applying a posture, or driving a resolved gate onward.
 * Answering a gate mid-park would publish against a worker that is being
 * stopped underneath it.
